*["What We Built"]

This story is over, it doesn't exist
What we built one day has vanished
It seems to be easier to leave us
But you're a ghost with me walking

Don't think it wasn't worth it
Don't think you're not important
On the contrary I loved you with all my soul

Don't think it wasn't worth it
Don't think we lost it
This hurts us, although it hurts, it is only ours

What we build is over
What we build is over
It was just ours
It was just ours

What we build is over
What we build is over
It takes the wind
It takes the wind

This story is over, it doesn't exist
What we built one day has vanished
It seems to be easier to leave us
But you're a ghost with me walking

I did not learn to let go of love
I did not learn to let you go
You were a long term bet
What we build, what we build

What we build is over
What we build is over
It was just ours
It was just ours

What we build is over
What we build is over
It takes the wind
It takes the wind

What we build is over
What we build is over
It was just ours
It was just ours

What we build is over
What we build is over
It takes the wind
It takes the wind

Skinny-kinny Flakk, yeah (Flakk, yeah, Flakk, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I've realized that I love you
I don't know what I do without you
I know that a few spoke to you
But you prefer me

Baby, I've realized that I love you (That I love you)
I don't know what I do without you
I know that a few talked to you (They talked to you)
But you prefer me, me, hey

[Verse 1]
Sheâ€™s like a sorceress
He stole my heart
So that I don't want any
He has thrown me a bad love
I spent the whole night
Inside your room
He always does it his way
He does it as the best

[Post-Verse]
She dances me, she goes crazy
He wants to grab me, bite my mouth
I'm watching how he throws
So pretty it hurts, it hurts

How does it make me crazy
Want it to end and start another
He says he has a broken heart
That's why he doesn't love me, he wants, girl

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I've realized that I love you
I don't know what I do without you

[Verse 2]
Half-life only
Waiting for the moment for my plans to come out
But, I think I leave everything
That mouth has me as wrapped in diamonds and now
Tell me what good is gold?
What good is this car and all these pendants?
If you shine more than all those bright ones, yeah
Too expensive to pay you

[Post-Verse]
She dances me, she goes crazy
He wants to grab me, bite my mouth
I'm watching how he throws it away (Uh)
So pretty it hurts, it hurts

How does it make me crazy
Want it to end and start another
He says he has a broken heart
That's why he doesn't love me, he wants, girl

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I've realized that I love you (That I love you)

*["Bonito"]

Beautiful, everything seems to me beautiful
Nice morning, nice place, nice bed
How good the sea looks!
Nice is the day ... just started
Nice life
Breathe, breathe, breathe!

The phone rings, my corduroy complains
The thing is going wrong, life weighs on him
What to live like this no longer interests you
What to do like this is not worth it
Love is lost, the party is over
The engine that pushes the earth is gone
Life is a joke with a sad ending
The future does not exist but I say pretty
Everything seems pretty to me
Beautiful, everything seems to me beautiful

Beautiful peace, beautiful life
Nice to be born again every day
Nice truth when it doesn't sound like a lie
Nice friendship, nice laugh
Nice people when there is quality
Nice people when you don't regret it
What wins and what loses. What speaks and does not lie
Nice people that's why I say nice
Everything seems pretty to me
How beautiful you are when you are beautiful, how beautiful you are
How beautiful you are when you are beautiful, how beautiful you are

[Instrumental]

Beautiful, everything seems to me beautiful
[Secondary voice] The sea, the morning, the house, the samba
The earth, the peace and the life that passes
[Lead Voice] Nice, everything seems pretty
[Secondary voice] Your bed, your sauce, the stain on the
Back, your face, your desire on the weekend
[Lead Voice] Nice people who come and go
Nice people who don't stop
Nice people who don't is old


What do you hear, what do you understand, what you have and what gives
Nice Portel, nice Peret
Pretty rumba, pretty Jose
Nice breeze that is not in a hurry
Nice this day, breathe, breathe
Nice people when it's real
Nice people who are different
What trembles, what feels
What does the present live
Nice people who were and are not
Beautiful, everything seems to me beautiful. [Secondary voice] Everything seems pretty!
[Lead vocal]
How beautiful you are when you are beautiful, how beautiful you are!
How beautiful it is when it is beautiful, how beautiful it is!
How beautiful you are when you are beautiful, how beautiful you are!
How beautiful it is, when it is beautiful, how beautiful it is!

*["Where Are You Heart?"]

[See 1]
Where are you Love?
Yesterday I looked for you
Between the ground, and the sky, my sky
And i didn't find you
I can think you're running from me
Because my silence a hunch
He says yes

Where are you Love?
Come back for me
That life becomes an eight
If you're not here
And I want to think (and I want to think)
That it will not take (that it will not take)
Because on the planet there is no
No one else I can love

[Chorus]
Where are you Love?
Yesterday I looked for you
Where are you Love?
And i didn't find you

[See 2]
Where are you Love?
You got out of here
Oh, looking for who knows what things
So far away from me
And i can think
And I think again
That it won't take (won't take)
Because on the planet
There is no one else
Who can I love

[Chorus]
Where are you Love?
Yesterday I looked for you
Where are you Love?
And i didn't find you

[Bridge]
I looked for you
In the closet
In the alphabet
Under the car
In the black, in the white
In the history books
In the magazines
And on the radio
I looked for you in the streets
Where your mother
In Botero's paintings
In my purse
In two thousand religions
I looked for you until
In my songs

[Chorus]
Where are you Love?
Yesterday I looked for you
Where are you Love?
And i didn't find you

[Outro]
I looked for you
In the closet
In the alphabet
Under the car
In the black, in the white
In the history books
In the magazines
And on the radio
I looked for you in the streets
Where your mother
In Botero's paintings
In my purse
In two thousand religions
I looked for you until
In my songs

Where are you Love?
Yesterday I looked for you

I looked for you
In the closet
In the alphabet
Under the car
In the black, in the white
In the history books
In the magazines
And on the radio


*["We Were So Good"]
[Spanish Translation]

[Verse 1]
You have told me a thousand times
It has stuck in my mind
You decided to leave
For urgent reasons

I have tried to accept it
These last months
But here I am crying
And I still don't understand

[Pre-chorus 1]
How did your heart get cold?
We were dissolving and I didn't notice anything
How was it and when did it break?
If we were so good

[Chorus]
How did you stop loving me?
Suddenly and without warning
Without asking for help and without giving me a choice
To save us on time

How did you stop loving me?
Suddenly and without warning
You gave me no option, no option
To save it in time

[Verse 2]
Now that I remember
I can already decipher
The signals you gave
Announcing the end

Your hugs burned
They wanted to kill me
But without frightening me
And without making me bleed

[Pre-chorus 2]
The distance inside you was so much
That we were sleeping almost in separate beds
But it was so much my patience and my illusion
I could not see it

[Chorus]
How did you stop loving me?
Suddenly and without warning
Without asking for help and without giving me a choice
To save us on time

How did you stop loving me?
Suddenly and without warning
You gave me no option, no option
To save it in time

[Pre-chorus 1]
How did your heart get cold?
We were dissolving and I didn't notice anything
How was it and when did it break?
If we were so good

[Chorus]
How did you stop loving me?
Suddenly and without warning
Without asking for help and without giving me a choice
To save us on time

How did you stop loving me?
Suddenly and without warning
You gave me no option, no option
To save it in time

[Outro]
You gave me no option, no option
You gave me no option, no option
You gave me no option, no option
To save it in time

Hey, yeah!
Dididiri Daddy, go!

[Intro: Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee]
Yes, you know I've been looking at you for a while
I have to dance with you today
(D.Y.!) I saw that your gaze was already calling me
Show me the way that I'm going

[Verse 1: Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee]
Oh!
You, you are the magnet and I am the metal
I'm getting closer and I'm putting together the plan
Just thinking about it accelerates the pulse (Oh, yeah!)
Already, I like it more than usual
All my senses are asking for more
This must be taken without any hurry

[Chorus: Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee]
Little
I want to breathe your neck slowly
Let me tell you things in my ear
So you remember if you're not with me
Little
I want to kiss you slowly
Sign the walls of your maze
And make your body a whole manuscript
(Go up, go up, go up, go up,

[Post-Chorus: Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee]
I want to see your hair dance, I want to be your rhythm (Woah, woah)
That you teach my mouth (Woah, woah)
Your favorite places (Favorite, favorite, baby)
Let me surpass your danger zones (Woah, woah)
To provoke your screams (Woah, woah)
And forget your last name

[Verse 2: Daddy Yankee]
If I ask you for a kiss, come, give it to me, I know you're thinking about it
I've been trying for a while, mommy, this is giving and giving
You know your heart with me makes you bang-bang
You know that baby is looking for my bang-bang
Come, try my mouth to see how it tastes
I want, I want, I want to see how much love you have
I'm not in a hurry, I want to take the trip
We start slow, then wild

[Pre-Chorus: Daddy Yankee]
Step by step, soft smooth
We are going to stick a little bit
When you kiss me with that skill
I see that you are malice with delicacy
Step by step, soft smooth
We are going to stick a little bit
And that beauty is a puzzle
But to mount it here I have the piece
Hears!

[Chorus: Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee]
Little
I want to breathe your neck slowly
Let me tell you things in my ear
So you remember if you're not with me
Little
I want to kiss you slowly
Sign the walls of your maze
And make your body a whole manuscript
(Go up, up, up, up, up)

[Post-Chorus: Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee]
I want to see your hair dance, I want to be your rhythm (Woah, woah)
That you teach my mouth (Woah, woah)
Your favorite places (Favorite, favorite, baby)
Let me surpass your danger zones (Woah, woah)
To provoke your screams (Woah, woah)
And forget your last name

[Verse 3: Luis Fonsi]
Little
Let's do it on a beach in Puerto Rico
Until the waves shout "Oh, Blessed!"
For my seal to stay with you
Dance it!

[Outro: Daddy Yankee & Luis Fonsi]
Step by step, soft smooth
We are going to stick a little bit
That you teach my mouth
Your favorite places
(Favorite, favorite, baby)
Step by step, soft smooth
We are going to stick a little bit
To provoke your screams (Fonsi)
And forget your last name (D.Y.)
Little
